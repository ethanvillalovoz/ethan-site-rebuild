            Hi, I'm Ethan Villalovoz

          <p className="mb-4">
            I am a recent graduate in Computer Science from Washington State
            University with a minor in Mathematics. My research spans robotics,
            machine learning, and AI safety, with a focus on reinforcement
            learning, human-AI collaboration, and large language models.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Iâ€™ve conducted research at Carnegie Mellon University (HARP Lab) on
            hierarchical reward learning, Oregon State University (CHARISMA Lab)
            on multi-robot navigation, and completed a software engineering
            internship at Google (STEP Intern), where I built scalable data
            processing and visualization systems to support internal analytics.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML research and
            engineering while preparing to apply for Ph.D. programs in Fall 2025.
